## ðŸ‘‹ Hello!

I'm a passionate C# fullstack developer, I learn on my own in free time.

I love sharing what I learn, for free of course - I will never ask you for money.

Most of my stuff will be under the Unlicense, do whatever you want with my code! Don't credit me, all this should've been free from the start. 

## ðŸ“« Contact?

Don't hesitate to reach out, I respect everyone!
